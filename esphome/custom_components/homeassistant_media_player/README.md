# HomeAssistantMediaPlayerGroup Component
The HomeAssistantMediaPlayerGroup component for ESPHome allows you to group multiple Home Assistant media players into a single entity. This is particularly useful for creating a unified menu for controlling playback across multiple media players.

Can be used in the [homeThing](https://github.com/landonr/homeThing) menu along with local or [Home Assistant media player entities](https://github.com/landonr/esphome-components/tree/main/components/homeassistant_media_player/media_player) 

## Base Configuration
The HomeAssistantMediaPlayerGroup component has several base configuration options. By default, appropriate values will be chosen for all of these options, but you can override them if you want to.

```yaml
